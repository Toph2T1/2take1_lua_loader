# 2Take1Menu Lua Loader
A Lua loader for Stand, designed to load 2Take1 Lua scripts.

This is still a **work in progress** so any contributions are appreciated.

## Installation
### Installing the loader
1. [Download the loader](https://github.com/Murten101/lua_loader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the downloaded files.
3. Move the `lib` folder and the `2Take1 Lua Loader.lua` file into your `%appdata%\Stand\Lua Scripts` folder.
4. Optionally, move the `From 2Take1Menu` folder to the `%appdata%\Stand\` folder.  
   - If you skip this step, the folder will be created automatically the first time you run the loader script.
### Installing & running 2Take1Menu scripts
1. Place any 2Take1Menu scripts (and their associated files, if any) into the `%appdata%\Stand\From 2Take1Menu\scripts` folder.  
   - If the folder doesn't exist, either create it manually or run the script and it will create it for you.
2. Open Stand and navigate to `Stand > Lua Scripts > 2Take1 Lua Loader`.
3. Run the loader script.
4. Once the script is running, navigate to the `Load Scripts` submenu within the loader menu then select a script to load it.
5. After successfully loading a script, return to the `2Take1 Lua Loader` submenu. The 2Take1 script features will appear under the **Script Features** section.
6. If a script is added to the folder while the loader script is running, use the "Reset State" feature to reset the script so it can see the new additions.
